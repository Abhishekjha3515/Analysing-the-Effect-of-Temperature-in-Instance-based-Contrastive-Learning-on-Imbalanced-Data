# Code Repository for "Analysing the Effect of Temperature in Instance-based Contrastive Learning on Imbalanced Data" 
-  This repository contains the code used for my Masterâ€™s thesis titled "Analysing Effect of Temperature in Instance-based Contrastive Learning on Imbalanced Data." The forked repository includes multiple 
   folders, but only the folder relevant to this thesis has been retained for clarity and efficiency.
-  smallscale directory contains the code to produce our results on CIFARLT  datasets
-  smallscale codes were run on NVIDIA A40

## Results

Below are the results obtained for different datasets used in this thesis:

Notes
This code has been tested on Python 3.8 with Ubuntu 20.04.

The dataset paths and related configurations need to be updated according to your local setup.
